# Purpose
&nbsp;

**H**ALO **O**bject **R**eport and a**N**alysis tool**S** (**HORNS**) is a set of tools to help scrutinize and check exported object (cellular) data output by the HALO imaging software. 

This app was developed in response to the growing availability and use of multiplex imaging platforms, such as the [Phenocycler][codex] (formerly [CODEX][codex]) platform. These platforms increase the amount of markers available to be imaged on a single specimen through flourescence immunohistochemistry from 3 to 60+. As one can expect, with an increase in captured information also comes an increase of data to parse through.

While more data is always appreciated in research, many labs accustomed to the traditional markers struggle to parse and analyse without special software or a background in data analytics. 

As mentioned above, this app deals with outputs from the [HALO image analysis software][halo] which is a common tool for image visualization, analysis, and classification. The tools included in this app are intended to hep researchers to check and quickly visualize results from classification analyses to look for possible problems and inconsistencies.
